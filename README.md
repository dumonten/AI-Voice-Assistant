## Introduction

This project aims to develop a voice AI bot on Aiogram, capable of receiving voice messages, converting them into text, and interacting with users to identify and save their key values. The bot will utilize the OpenAI API to process and respond to user queries, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

## Assignment №1: Development of a Voice AI Bot on Aiogram

### Project Goal

The goal of this assignment is to create a Telegram chatbot on Aiogram that can:

- Receive voice messages from users
- Convert these messages into text
- Process user queries and provide answers
- Speak the answers back to the user using an asynchronous client of the OpenAI API

## Assignment №2: Development of a Bot for Identifying and Saving User Values

### Project Goal

Building upon the voice AI bot developed in Assignment №1, this assignment focuses on enhancing the bot's ability to:

- Communicate with users to determine their key values
- Use the OpenAI Assistant API to record these values in the user's database
- Validate the identified values using functools in the Completions API to ensure accuracy before recording
